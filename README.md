# magento2_new_theme_start_up

Clone this and put into app/design/frontend/{VendorName}.

Update the theme.xml and registration.php to suit the requirement.

Optional files:
1. composer.json (Remove it if your new theme is not a composer packagist)
2. etc/view.xml
3. Magento_Theme/layout/default.xml

Please alwasy refer the Magento 2 Office guide: http://devdocs.magento.com/guides/v2.0/frontend-dev-guide/themes/theme-create.html

Good luck!
